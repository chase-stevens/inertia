# Inertia

Inertia is a Chrome extension that alters your new tab screen to show the time,
weather, and a beautiful gradient that loads instantly. You can install Inertia
for your browser [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/inertia/edmiaglmnempkbeceifdeicnfknfpngf).

## Greeting
The greeting displays the time as well as your name. If you haven't set your name with Inertia, it will ask you for your
name and will store it as a cookie.

## Weather
The weather checks your geolocation and then looks up the weather via your latitude and longitude coordinates on https://openweathermap.org/

## Gradient
There are seven gradient backgrounds that rotate daily -- see which one's your favorite!
